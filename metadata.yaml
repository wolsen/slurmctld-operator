  Slurmctld, the central management daemon of Slurm.
description: |
  This charm provides slurmctld, munged, and the bindings to other utilities
  that make lifecycle operations a breeze.
  
  slurmctld is the central management daemon of SLURM. It monitors all other
  SLURM daemons and resources, accepts work (jobs), and allocates resources
  to those jobs.  Given the critical functionality of slurmctld, there may be
  a backup server to assume these functions in the event that the primary
  server fails.
